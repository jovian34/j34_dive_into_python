mapping program to translate between integers and Roman numerals

Roman numberals only exist between 1 and 3999

from http://www.diveintopython3.net/unit-testing.html

The rules for Roman numerals lead to a number of interesting observations:

There is only one correct way to represent a particular number as a Roman numeral.
The converse is also true: if a string of characters is a valid Roman numeral,
    it represents only one number (that is, it can only be interpreted one way).
There is a limited range of numbers that can be expressed as Roman numerals,
    specifically 1 through 3999. The Romans did have several ways of expressing
    larger numbers, for instance by having a bar over a numeral to represent
    that its normal value should be multiplied by 1000. For the purposes
    of this chapter, letâ€™s stipulate that Roman numerals go from 1 to 3999.
There is no way to represent 0 in Roman numerals.
There is no way to represent negative numbers in Roman numerals.
There is no way to represent fractions or non-integer numbers in Roman numerals.
