# j34_dive_into_python
These are my working results while going through the online book Dive Into Python 3: 
http://www.diveintopython3.net

##square_root.py
This was a file I wrote to calculate a square root for the pythagorean.  It turns out I didn't
need it, but it is functional on its own so I left it in place

##pythagorean_triplets.py
I took this challenge from STDIG Python #2 on YouTube
https://youtu.be/LN-kUWW_9wM
This is my solution which I have been tweeking slightly as I go through the course

###tests
I am also practing writing tests with pytest

####disclaimer
This has no specific purpose besides learning programming and coding in Python 3
